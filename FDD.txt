Square 1:

Starting by the most apparently annoying feature:
10: 
- Come back to Logo and reintegrate it
- Do some research on the optimal textbook form for personages export (apparently 4) on Курс Горячево
- Test the imported personage

Next feature, based on results from the previous one:
11:
- Chose another personage and estimate the max possible degree of generalization
- Develop the base skeleton to simplify personage adding
- (Optional) Develop a system of #defines to simplify personage adding even more

3: (The following tips are made just for future redesign of the plan)
- Check TXLib for clues for signal handling
- (Alternatives) Evaluate pros and cons about Msvc SEH and Mingw signal handling
- Change the Environment if needed

4: (The following tips are made just for future redesign of the plan)
- Specification: step by step debugger, similar to ollydbg
- (Alternatives) Jit debugging based on Int3 or MessageBox
- (Alternatives) Debug info displayed in:   - logfile
					    - Window, editbox with momentaneum changes
					    - Simple popup window on each step (MessageBox)
